Say hello to your final comic book viewer. 

The history of this application is very interesting. 
I'm a comic book reader (and collector) for a long time. And, as a developer, i wanted to study and learn a new programing language (in this case, Xamarin). So i put this things togheter and decided to make a CBZ file reader that would meet my needs. 
With the result already satisfying me, i decided to publish the app in the store to facilitate the distribution to the friends who started to ask me to install it on their devices.
In fact, this is the result of a learning work, but done with love and dedication. All critics and suggestion will be welcomed.

It's really straightforward.
Select and folder on your device where you put yor comic books (those CBZ files).
The app will continually search your folder for newly added files.
Then extract covers and display it as a eye candy shelf.
You click the one you want to read, and start fliping the pages.
The app will learn from your reading habits and suggest other comics from your library for you.

Happy reading.
